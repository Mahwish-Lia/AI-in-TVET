* It should support—never replace—**teachers' professional judgment** and **students' agency**

**2️⃣ Ensure equitable and inclusive access**

* AI must avoid reinforcing **existing inequalities** (language, disability, socio-economic status)
* All learners should have the opportunity to benefit from AI

**3️⃣ Promote explainability, safety & responsible use**

* AI systems should be **transparent and understandable**
* They must protect learners' **rights, dignity, and well-being**

**4️⃣ Maintain human control & accountability**

* Humans remain **responsible** for educational decisions
* AI can support decisions, but must not replace human oversight

### 🎯 A 'Human-Centred and Pedagogically Appropriate Interaction' Approach

Researchers and educators should prioritize human agency and responsible, pedagogically appropriate interaction between humans and AI tools when deciding whether and how to use GenAI. This includes five considerations:

**🎓 Contribution to human needs and learning effectiveness**

* The tool should contribute to human needs and make learning or research more effective than a no-tech or alternative approach.

**💡 Intrinsic motivation**

* Educators' and learners' use of the tool should be based on intrinsic motivation.

**🎮 Human control over the process**

* The process should remain controlled by human educators, learners, or researchers.

**Citation:** UNESCO. (2023). *Guidance for generative AI in education and research* (p. 29). UNESCO. https://doi.org/10.54675/EWZM9535

### 🎯 Pedagogically Appropriate Interaction (Continued)

**📏 Proportionate and developmentally appropriate use**

* Tool choice and AI-generated content must align with learners' age, expected outcomes, and the type of target knowledge (factual, conceptual, procedural, or metacognitive) or problem (well-structured or ill-structured).

**🧠 Ensure interactive engagement and higher-order thinking**

* AI use should promote interactive engagement, support higher-order thinking, and ensure human accountability for decisions related to AI-generated content and its influence on behaviour.

**Citation:** UNESCO. (2023). *Guidance for generative AI in education and research* (p. 29). UNESCO. https://doi.org/10.54675/EWZM9535

### 🔧 Co-Design Framework

To support co-design, this guidance proposes a framework composed of six perspectives to consolidate pedagogically appropriate interactions and prioritization of human agency:

1. ✅ Appropriate domains of knowledge or problems
2. 🎯 Expected outcomes
3. 🛠️ Appropriate GenAI tools and comparative advantages
4. 👤 Requirements for users
5. 📚 Required human pedagogical methods and example prompts
6. ⚠️ Ethical risks

This section provides examples of how co-design in the use of GenAI can inform research practices, assist in teaching, provide coaching for foundational skills, facilitate higher-order thinking, and support learners with special needs.

## 📋 Part 2 – Case Study Analysis

### 🔴 Case Study 1: The AutoGrade Assistant

A technical training institute introduces an AI system called **AutoGrade Assistant** to help evaluate student assignments. Here is how it is used:

* ⚙️ The AI reads written assignments and automatically generates a **score** and **short feedback**
* ⏱️ Teachers **may** check the AI's evaluation, but the institute encourages them to "trust the system" to save time
* 🔒 Students receive grades instantly, but **they are not told** what data the AI uses or how decisions are made
* ❌ There is **no option for students** to request a human review unless they file a formal complaint
* 📚 Teachers receive **no training** on how the system works, how to verify accuracy, or how to handle errors
* 💼 The institute mainly adopted the tool for **efficiency and time savings**, not for pedagogical reasons

### 🟡 Case Study 2: AI Welding Coach

A vocational welding centre adopts an AI tool called **WeldPerfect**. The system analyses student welds through video, gives an automatic score, and highlights mistakes.

**How it is used:**

* 🎥 Students practice independently; the AI provides feedback without a teacher present
* 📊 Teachers receive weekly summaries but **do not review each student's feedback**
* ❓ Learners **cannot ask questions** about why the AI deducted points
* 🔒 The system's training data (types of welds, materials, techniques) is **not disclosed**
* 🤖 The institute markets the tool as a **"replacement for basic instructor feedback"**

### 🟢 Case Study 3: Automotive Diagnostics AI

An automotive training school integrates **AutoSense**, an AI engine-diagnostic simulator. Students enter symptoms, and the AI suggests likely faults.

**How it is used:**

* 🎓 Teachers use AutoSense during class but ask students to **justify or challenge** the AI's diagnosis
* ⚠️ Students are taught the **limitations** of the system and when it may be wrong
* 🔄 Learners can switch between AI assistance and **manual diagnostic tasks**
* 🔐 No student data is stored
* 🤝 AI is introduced as a **support tool**, not a decision-maker
* 📚 Training is provided to both teachers and students

### 🟠 Case Study 4: Hospitality & Cooking AI Planner

A culinary school begins using an AI tool called **MenuMaster** that creates personalized recipe plans and skill-development pathways.
