## üé§ Component 2: LiaScript Pitch Presentation 

### What You're Creating

A **10-minute interactive presentation** created in LiaScript that pitches your microcredential to a simulated TVET institution decision-making panel (provost, curriculum director, industry partners).




## üéñÔ∏è Component 3: Digital Badge Design

### What You're Creating

A **professional digital badge** with complete metadata that could actually be issued to learners who complete your microcredential, following Open Badges 3.0 standards.

### Why Digital Badges?

- Portable, verifiable credentials
- Stackable micro-credentials
- Rich metadata about skills and competencies
- Integration with digital portfolios, LinkedIn, etc.
- Growing recognition by employers


#### 3.1 Visual Badge Design 

**Technical specifications:**

- Format: SVG (preferred) or PNG
- Size: Square, minimum 512√ó512 pixels
- File size: Under 256KB
- Design principles:
  - Recognizable at small sizes (as small as 64√ó64px)
  - Incorporates TVET sector identity
  - Professional appearance
  - Accessible (sufficient color contrast, not text-dependent)
  - Unique and memorable

**Design tips:**

- Use sector-relevant iconography (e.g., wrench for trades, stethoscope for healthcare)
- Consider using your institution's colors
- Include symbolic AI element if appropriate
- Keep it simple‚Äîoverly complex designs don't scale well
- Test at multiple sizes

**Tools you can use:**

- Canva (free templates available)
- Figma (professional design tool)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Inkscape (free, open-source)


#### 3.3 Evidence Requirements for badge earner 

**What evidence must badge earners provide?**



- **Assessment artifacts required:** What must learners submit?

  - Examples: portfolio, video demonstration, project, case study, etc.
- **Performance standards:** What quality level must be achieved?
- **Verification process:** How will evidence be reviewed and validated?
- **Timeline:** When must evidence be submitted?
- **Appeals process:** What if learner disagrees with assessment?

## ü§ñ Component 4: AI Co-Design Documentation & Reflection

### 4.1 What You're Creating

Transparent, critical documentation of how you used AI tools throughout your microcredential design process‚Äîdemonstrating both effective prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI outputs.

Deliverable: Word doc... or pdf(1k-1.5k)

#### 4.1.1 AI Integration Plan 

**Document where, how, and why you're integrating AI**

For Example See the table below:

| Integration Point | AI Tool/Type | Pedagogical Purpose | Expected Outcome | Ethical Considerations |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Example: Module 2, Activity 1 | ChatGPT for scenario generation | Learners practice troubleshooting with AI-generated realistic scenarios | Improved diagnostic reasoning in varied contexts | Ensure scenarios reflect diverse workplaces, not biased |

#### 4.1.2 AI Tools Log 

**Comprehensive record of ALL AI tool usage** during your project.



| Date | Session # | Tool Used | Specific Purpose | Input/Prompt Summary | Output Summary | Your Evaluation | What You Kept/Changed |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Oct 15 | 1 | ChatGPT-4 | Generate learning objectives | "Create learning objectives for welding safety module" | 6 objectives listed, mostly knowledge-level | Too generic, not TVET-specific, wrong Bloom's level | Used framework but rewrote all 6 to focus on application |
| Oct 17 | 2 | Claude | Develop assessment rubric | [Insert actual prompt] | Detailed 4-level rubric | Excellent structure but missing TVET context clues | Kept structure, added industry-specific criteria |

**Minimum entries:** 10-15 significant interactions

**Include:**

- Content generation (objectives, activities, scenarios)
- Assessment design
- Instructional materials development
- Proofreading or editing
- Research or idea generation
- Badge design elements (if AI-assisted)
- Any other AI usage

**Be thorough and honest‚Äîthis is about transparency and learning, not perfection.**

#### 4.1.3 Prompt Generation & Iteration

**Select any-one significant prompting interaction** and provide deep documentation.

**For each interaction, include:**

1. **Context:** What were you trying to accomplish?
2. **Initial Prompt:** Your first attempt (exact text)
3. **AI Response:** Summary or relevant excerpt
4. **Your Critique:** What worked? What didn't? Why?
5. **Iteration(s):** How did you refine your prompt? (show 1-3 iterations)
6. **Final Outcome:** What did you ultimately use in your microcredential?
7. **Reflection:** What did this teach you about prompting or AI capabilities?

**Example format:**

---

**Prompt Engineering Example #1: Developing Authentic Scenarios**

**Context:**  
I needed a realistic workplace scenario for my automotive diagnostics module where learners practice troubleshooting electrical issues.

**Initial Prompt (Iteration 1):**  
```
Create a scenario for automotive electrical troubleshooting.
```

**AI Response:**  
*Claude generated a basic scenario about a car with a dead battery. It was generic and didn't require diagnostic reasoning‚Äîjust "check the battery."*

**My Critique:**  

- Too simplistic‚Äîno real troubleshooting needed
- Not authentic to professional automotive practice
- Didn't specify learner level or learning objectives
- Missing complexity that would require systematic diagnosis

**Refined Prompt (Iteration 2):** 

```
You are an automotive TVET instructor. Create an intermediate-level troubleshooting scenario where a customer's vehicle has intermittent electrical issues. The scenario should require systematic diagnostic procedures and could have multiple possible causes. Include: customer complaint, initial symptoms, and vehicle information. Do NOT include the solution‚Äîlearners should diagnose it.

```

**AI Response:**  
*Much better! Claude created a scenario with intermittent starting issues, multiple symptoms, and ambiguous clues requiring systematic testing. More realistic and challenging.*

**My Critique:**

- ‚úÖ Appropriate complexity level
- ‚úÖ Requires systematic approach
- ‚úÖ Authentic customer language
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could use more red herrings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make vehicle specifications more specific (year, make, model)

**Final Refinement (Iteration 3):**  

[Your refined prompt building on iteration 2...]


**Final Outcome:**  
I used the scenario from iteration 3 with minor modifications: I added specific vehicle details (2018 Honda Accord), included a red herring (customer mentioned oil change last week), and adjusted the symptom pattern to match real-world intermittent electrical faults I've seen.

**Reflection/Learning:**  

Effective prompts for TVET scenarios require:

- Role specification ("you are a TVET instructor")
- Level/audience clarity
- Structure requirements (what to include/exclude)
- Authenticity cues (customer language, real-world complexity)
- Multiple iterations to refine

AI is excellent at structure but needs human expertise to ensure technical accuracy and authentic workplace context.

#### 4.1.4 Before/After Comparison

**Select any one  artifacts** from your microcredential and show the evolution from AI-generated to your final human-refined version.

**For each artifact:**

1. **Original AI-Generated Version:** Show what the AI produced
2. **Your Final Version:** Show what you actually used
3. **Annotated Explanation:** Use comment bubbles, highlights, or side-by-side notes explaining:

   - What you changed
   - Why you changed it
   - What this reveals about AI capabilities/limitations

**Suggested artifacts to compare:**

- Learning objectives (before/after)
- Assessment rubric (before/after)
- Scenario or case study (before/after)
- Instructional content section (before/after)
- Assessment task description (before/after)
- clear visual comparison (tables, side-by-side, annotation)
