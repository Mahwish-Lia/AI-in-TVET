## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I work individually instead of in a team?**

    {{1}}
********************************************************************************
While team collaboration is encouraged, individual submissions are accepted with instructor approval. Adjust scope accordingly.
********************************************************************************

**What if I don't have coding skills for the prototype?**

    {{2}}
********************************************************************************
You can use no-code/low-code platforms like:

- Chatbot builders (Chatfuel, ManyChat)
- H5P for interactive content
- Google Forms + AI integration
- Existing platforms with configuration
********************************************************************************

**How specific should my TVET skill focus be?**

    {{3}}
********************************************************************************
Be specific enough to design meaningfully. Good example: "Teaching proper knife skills in culinary arts" rather than "Teaching cooking."
********************************************************************************

**Can I use proprietary/paid AI tools?**

    {{4}}
********************************************************************************
Yes, but provide alternatives or explain institutional access. Ensure your prototype can be demonstrated to assessors.

 ### DeepSeek-R1‚Äôs reasoning process during micro-credential definition

```
Okay, I need to create a university-level microcredential program on "Artificial Intelligence"
following the guidelines from the provided Spanish
documents. Let me start by understanding what those
documents require.
First, the "Orientaciones para el diseÀúno y acreditaci¬¥on
de las Microcredenciales Universitarias" emphasizes
employability, quality assurance, modularity, and
alignment with European standards. The microcredential should be part of lifelong learning,
targeting professionals seeking upskilling. Since it
‚Äôs beginner-level, the content should be
foundational.
...
Next, the micro-credential must include details like
start/end dates, language (Spanish, probably),
admission requirements (maybe no prior degree needed
but basic math skills?), mode of instruction (
hybrid, as per the example), workload in ECTS (since
it‚Äôs beginner, maybe 5 ECTS, which is 125 hours
total).

# How Challenges Become Opportunities:
## Micro-credentials and Artificial Intelligence

> Authors: Carlos Delgado Kloos et al., Universidad Carlos III de Madrid

> Year: 2025 | IEEE EDUCON Conference Paper  

---

## üéØ Abstract Summary

As we move from the **Information Age** to the **Intelligence Age**, universities must adapt to two major challenges:

- **Micro-credentials:** Short, skill-focused learning experiences designed for reskilling and upskilling.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Transforming how education is designed, delivered, and certified.

The paper explores how **AI can support the creation, delivery, and certification of micro-credentials**, making them more agile, personalized, and industry-relevant.

---

## üß© 1. Introduction

- Micro-credentials are small learning units that certify **specific competencies**.  
- The **European Commission** recommends that 60% of the workforce participate in such programs annually.  
- Universities must evolve from a ‚Äú3+2 years‚Äù model (Bachelor + Master) to **lifelong learning** for professionals.
- **AI (especially Generative AI)**‚Äîlike ChatGPT‚Äîhas changed education by supporting:

  - Course design and material generation  
  - Personalized learning and real-time feedback  
  - Automated monitoring and assessment

---

## üîÅ 2. Micro-Credential Workflow

The **workflow** includes:

1. **Design Phase:** Define learning objectives and materials.  
2. **Enactment Phase:** Teach, engage learners, and assess outcomes.  
3. **Certification Phase:** Issue digital credentials.

üß† **AI applications** at each stage:

- Helps teachers design objectives, materials, and feedback.
- Supports students through mentoring, rephrasing, or self-assessment.
- Enhances agility, reusability, and rapid course updates.

---

## üíª 3. Formats for Digital Credentials

Two main digital credential formats:

1. **OpenBadges 3.0**  
2. **European Learning Model (ELM v3)**

Both use **W3C Verifiable Credentials** for secure, interoperable digital certificates.

Key ELM elements:

- Learning Achievement  
- Learning Activity  
- Learning Outcome  
- Learning Assessment  
- Learning Entitlement  

üßæ Distinction:

- **Learning Objectives:** Instructor-centered intentions.  
- **Learning Outcomes:** Student-centered, measurable results stored in digital credentials.

---

## üß† 4. Case Study: Designing a Micro-Credential with AI

A **university-level micro-credential on Artificial Intelligence** was designed using four AI tools:

- **ChatGPT o3-mini**
- **ChatGPT GPT-4 Turbo**
- **DeepSeek-R1**
- **NotebookLM (Gemini 2.0)**

### Process:

AI tools received official European and Spanish guidelines and generated a course structure with:

1. **Identification** (recipient, university, credential name)
2. **Learning Experience** (objectives, content, outcomes, workload)
3. **Assessment and Certification** (evaluation methods, quality assurance)

---

## üìö Example AI Outputs

| AI Tool | Highlights |
|----------|-------------|
| **o3-mini** | Modular, hybrid mode; focuses on ESCO-linked skills. |
| **DeepSeek-R1** | Detailed workload split (2 ECTS theory, 3 ECTS practice); blockchain-based verification. |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | Balanced practical-theoretical design; includes peer review. |
| **NotebookLM** | Policy-driven; strong in quality assurance and European compliance. |

AI-generated learning outcomes were aligned with **ESCO** and **DIGCOMP** frameworks.
