## 🧠 Understanding AI Pedagogy

According to **UNESCO's AI Competency Framework for Teachers**,  
**AI pedagogy** proposes a set of competencies required for **purposeful and effective AI–pedagogy integration**.

It encompasses **comprehensive competencies** to:

- Validate and select appropriate AI tools 🤖  
- Integrate AI with sound pedagogical methods 🎯  
- Support **course preparation, teaching, learning, socialization, social caring,** and **assessment**  

This means educators must develop the ability to:
- **Critically assess** *when and how* to use AI in ethical, human-centered ways  
- **Plan and implement** inclusive AI-assisted learning practices  
- **Continuously adapt and creatively explore** innovative approaches as AI capabilities evolve  

> 💬 *AI pedagogy is not about replacing teachers with technology – it's about expanding human potential through thoughtful, ethical, and creative integration.*

**📝 Quick Check**

AI pedagogy primarily requires teachers to:

[[ ]] Learn every new AI tool as it appears.  
[[X]] Critically select, ethically integrate, and adapt AI to support human-centered learning.  
[[ ]] Let AI systems automatically decide how learning is structured.  
[[?]] ✅ Correct: It's about **critical, ethical, purposeful** integration of AI.

## 📈 Progression Levels of AI Pedagogy

Teachers develop AI pedagogy gradually:

| Level | Role                     | Example                                    |
|:-----|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **1. Acquire** | Use AI as support tool   | AI simulator in automotive diagnostics     |
| **2. Deepen**  | Integrate into design    | AI simulation + hands-on lab work         |
| **3. Create**  | Innovate & co-develop    | Region-specific diagnostic AI solutions   |

> 🔄 *AI pedagogy grows from using tools – to shaping them.*

**📝 Quick Check**

At the **Create** level, a teacher:

- Pedagogy becomes an **afterthought** behind analytics

🎯 We must guard against models where optimisation replaces imagination and reclaim teaching as a **creative, social, ethical act**.

**📝 Quick Check**

What is the main danger of the closed-loop model?

[[ ]] It makes teachers too powerful in decision-making.  
[[X]] It sidelines teachers and students as agents, prioritising optimisation over pedagogy.  
[[ ]] It completely removes AI from learning.  
[[?]] ✅ Correct: It risks **displacing human agency and pedagogy**.
